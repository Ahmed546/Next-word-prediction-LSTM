# Next-word-prediction-LSTM
This project implements a Next Word Prediction model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The goal of the model is to predict the next word in a sentence, given a sequence of words. Such a model has applications in text auto-completion, chatbots, and various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
